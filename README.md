- 👋 Hi, I’m @shannon-bart (aka Shannon)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning R for data analysis with the goal of returning to the field of environmental science after a couple of years of self employment. You can take the girl out of the scientist role, but you can't take the scientist out of the girl :)
- 🌱 I’m currently working my way through JHU's Data Science Specialization course (through Coursera), and am part of an 'R for Data Science' book club.
- 💞️ I’m probably not ready to collaborate on anything yet, but would love to 'meet' and learn from those of you who work with environmental data using R.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
